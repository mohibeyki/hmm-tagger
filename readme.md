## Introduction

There are two notebookes, the HMM warmup (optional) is a simple introduction on how to create and use hidden Markov models, the other, is the project notebook. It parses brown dataset, splits it into training and testing datasets, creates a HMM on the training set and then calculates tags for testing dataset and compares it with the known tags for them.
